Cry Wolf
A Cat Nap
Wouldn't Harm a Fly
Put a Sock In It
Plot Thickens
Two Down, One to Go
Mouth-watering
Jaws of Life
Know the Ropes
There's No I in Team
Lickety Split
Back To the Drawing Board
Long In The Tooth
Curiosity Killed The Cat
What Am I, Chopped Liver?
Cut The Mustard
In the Red
Keep Your Eyes Peeled
Happy as a Clam
Man of Few Words
When the Rubber Hits the Road
Son of a Gun
Lovey Dovey
Throw In the Towel
A Cold Day in July
Under the Weather
Everything But The Kitchen Sink
All Greek To Me
Fight Fire With Fire
Foaming At The Mouth
Fish Out Of Water
Jumping the Gun
Yada Yada
On the Ropes
Jig Is Up
A Leg Up
A Lot on One’s Plate
Down And Out
Raining Cats and Dogs
Right Off the Bat
On the Same Page
High And Dry
A Lemon
Like Father Like Son
Roll With the Punches
Playing Possum
A Few Sandwiches Short of a Picnic
Cup Of Joe
Talk the Talk
You Can't Teach an Old Dog New Tricks
Jumping the Gun
A Guinea Pig
If You Can't Stand the Heat, Get Out of the Kitchen
You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover
A Busy Bee
Playing Possum
Goody Two-Shoes
Ring Any Bells?
Up In Arms
Give a Man a Fish
What Am I, Chopped Liver?
There's No I in Team
A Lone Wolf
Roll With the Punches
Down And Out
Par For the Course
I Smell a Rat
Cut The Mustard
Beating Around the Bush
Long In The Tooth
Flea Market
Right Off the Bat
Close But No Cigar
Mouth-watering
Happy as a Clam
Hit Below The Belt
Don't Count Your Chickens Before They Hatch
My Cup of Tea
Back to Square One
Between a Rock and a Hard Place
Needle In a Haystack
Wake Up Call
A Hair’s Breadth
Keep On Truckin'
Read 'Em and Weep
Son of a Gun
Beating a Dead Horse
Barking Up The Wrong Tree
A Day Late and a Dollar Short
No Ifs, Ands, or Buts
Mountain Out of a Molehill
Like Father Like Son
Money Doesn't Grow On Trees
It's Not All It's Cracked Up To Be
A Few Sandwiches Short of a Picnic
Put a Sock In It
All Greek To Me
A Home Bird
Drawing a Blank
Down To Earth
